## Smart Plant Watering System

##### Hardware used:
- STM32 Nucleo c031
- SSD 1327 Black and White Oled Display (128x128)
- Capacitive Soil Sensor
- TSL2591 Light Sensor
- 5V External Battery

##### Project Description: 
- Developed a RTOS system using STM32 microcontroller to monitor soil moisture, temperature, and light,
with automated watering functionality.
- Programmed and calibrated analog/digital sensor logic to enable accurate data collection and automated
watering functionality based on predefined thresholds.
- Implemented an OLED-based user interface to display real-time soil moisture levels
